Formula Test with Sample Data:

Original Formula: =(J3/DAY(EOMONTH(I3,0)))*N3

Sample Row:
- I3 (Month): 01/01/2024 (January = 31 days)
- J3 (Days): 31
- N3 (Oil Factor): 100

Calculation:
- DAY(EOMONTH(01/01/2024,0)) = 31 (days in January)
- J3/DAY(EOMONTH(I3,0)) = 31/31 = 1.0
- Final result = 1.0 * 100 = 100

This suggests:
- If J3 = total days in month → Formula just returns N3
- If J3 = operational days < total days → Formula scales down N3
